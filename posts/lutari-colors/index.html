While there are some general tips that apply to all types of Anime, here are some specific recommendations for those who enjoy the genre of Anime:

-If you&rsquo;re looking for something more drawn out, try checking out OVA&rsquo;s or one-shots before getting into the full series. These episodes usually have less action and more atmosphere, which can add to your enjoyment while giving you more closure on the story.</p><h2 id=neocolours-the-neopets-colourspecies-guide---view-pets-6>Neocolours: The Neopets Colour/species Guide - View Pets<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#neocolours-the-neopets-colourspecies-guide---view-pets-6>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=http://images.neopets.com/pets/lutari_pink_baby.gif onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.gI_MQf2L2tQkivCNGx9QuwHaHa&amp;pid=15.1"' alt="Neocolours: the Neopets colour/species guide - View Pets"><p><em>Source: neocolours.me.uk</em></p><blockquote><p>lutari pink neopets old species circle.</p></blockquote><p>Recommendations for watching anime: You can
