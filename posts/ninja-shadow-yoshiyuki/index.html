While there are some general tips that apply to all types of Anime, here are some specific recommendations for those who enjoy the genre of Anime:
-Watching a new show immediately after its release is always a great way to start an AnimeWalker day. This will give you a sense of when the next episode will air and provide you with a recap of the story before you even get started watching.
-If you&rsquo;re looking for something more drawn out, try checking out OVA&rsquo;s or one-shots before getting into the full series. These episodes usually have less action and more atmosphere, which can add to your enjoyment while giving you more closure on the story.</p><h2 id=otome-otaku-girl-shall-we-date-ninja-shadow--season-4-okita---main>Otome Otaku Girl: Shall We Date?: Ninja Shadow + Season 4: Okita - Main<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#otome-otaku-girl-shall-we-date-ninja-shadow--season-4-okita---main>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-hlK6vPgiA_Q/WhHyOTPdmFI/AAAAAAABFl4/TR9YC0tq0ro3seSjftAnuuBnK57JBBkQQCLcBGAs/s640/IMG_6783.PNG onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse3.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.WGS6vMztrf6NZEPJ8Zo3HAHaEK&amp;pid=15.1"' alt="Otome Otaku Girl: Shall we date?: Ninja Shadow + Season 4: Okita - Main"><p><em>Source: otomeotakugirl.blogspot.com</em></p><blockquote><p>ninja shadow okita date shall cg main chapter season story girl otaku otome.</p></blockquote><ol start=2><li>lavender</li></ol><h2 id=tanabata--yoshiyuki-amp-haku--ninja-shadow-shadow-anime>Tanabata- Yoshiyuki & Haku | Ninja Shadow, Shadow, Anime<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#tanabata--yoshiyuki-amp-haku--ninja-shadow-shadow-anime>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/be/ba/47/beba47fed22c17ef74cd20b0c77929a2.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.zcgl3fbSpIMa81xjKHgFTAHaEK&amp;pid=15.1"' alt="Tanabata- Yoshiyuki & Haku | Ninja shadow, Shadow, Anime"><p><em>Source: pinterest.com</em></p><blockquote><p>.</p></blockquote><p>Best way to show off your wallpaper:
